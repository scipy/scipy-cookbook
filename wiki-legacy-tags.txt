Graphics
========

There are several packages available to produce interactive screen
graphics (use the mouse to zoom, orient, and fine-tune) and
publication-quality printed plots, in 2D, 3D, and 4D (animations).

released separately.  However, their developers work closely with the
SciPy developers to ensure compatibility.
