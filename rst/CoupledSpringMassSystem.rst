This cookbook example shows how to solve a system of differential
equations. (Other examples include the
[:LoktaVolterraTutorial:Lotka-Volterra Tutorial], the
[:Cookbook/Zombie\_Apocalypse\_ODEINT:Zombie Apocalypse] and the
[:Cookbook/KdV: KdV example].)

A Coupled Spring-Mass System
----------------------------

This figure shows the system to be modeled:

.. image:: CoupledSpringMassSystem_attachments/two_springs_diagram.png

Two objects with masses m,,1,, and m,,2,, are coupled through springs
with spring constants k,,1,, and k,,2,,. The left end of the left spring
is fixed. We assume that the lengths of the springs, when subjected to
no external forces, are L,,1,, and L,,2,,.

The masses are sliding on a surface that creates friction, so there are
two friction coefficients, b,,1,, and b,,2,,.

The differential equations for this system are

m,,1,, x,,1,,' ' + b,,1,, x,,1,,' + k,,1,, (x,,1,, - L,,1,,) - k,,2,,
(x,,2,, - x,,1,, - L,,2,,) = 0

m,,2,, x,,2,,' ' + b,,2,, x,,2,,' + k,,2,, (x,,2,, - x,,1,, - L,,2,,) =
0

This is a pair of coupled second order equations. To solve this system
with one of the ODE solvers provided by SciPy, we must first convert
this to a system of first order differential equations. We introduce two
variables

y,,1,, = x,,1,,', y,,2,, = x,,2,,'

These are the velocities of the masses.

With a little algebra, we can rewrite the two second order equations as
the following system of four first order equations:

x,,1,,' = y,,1,,

y,,1,,' = (-b,,1,, y,,1,, - k,,1,, (x,,1,, - L,,1,,) + k,,2,, (x,,2,, -
x,,1,, - L,,2,,))/m,,1,,

x,,2,,' = y,,2,,

y,,2,,' = (-b,,2,, y,,2,, - k,,2,, (x,,2,, - x,,1,, - L,,2,,))/m,,2,,

These equations are now in a form that we can implement in Python.

The following code defines the "right hand side" of the system of
equations (also known as a vector field). I have chosen to put the
function that defines the vector field in its own module (i.e. in its
own file), but this is not necessary. Note that the arguments of the
function are configured to be used with the function: the time t is the
second argument.

    # two_springs.py
    #
    """
    This module defines the vector field for a spring-mass system
    consisting of two masses and two springs.
    """
    
    
    def vectorfield(w, t, p):

            t :  time
            p :  vector of the parameters:
                      p = [m1,m2,k1,k2,L1,L2,b1,b2]
        """
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = w
        m1, m2, k1, k2, L1, L2, b1, b2 = p
    
        # Create f = (x1',y1',x2',y2'):
        f = [y1,
             (-b1 * y1 - k1 * (x1 - L1) + k2 * (x2 - x1 - L2)) / m1,
             y2,
             (-b2 * y2 - k2 * (x2 - x1 - L2)) / m2]
        return f
    



Next, here is a script that uses to solve the equations for a given set
of parameter values, initial conditions, and time interval. The script
prints the points in the solution to the terminal. Normally you will
redirect its output to a file.

    wsol = odeint(two_springs.vectorfield, w0, t, args=(p,),
                  atol=abserr, rtol=relerr)

    for t1, w1 in zip(t, wsol):
